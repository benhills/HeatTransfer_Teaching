    "# Thermal Diffusion in Ice\n",

    "\n",
    "To gain experience with some solutions to this heat equation, we have prepared a Python notebook. The idea is to allow you to vary input parameters for a few scenarios and learn to better anticipate what the results might be. It is not important that you have a background in coding with python. Rather, the intent here is that you adjust inputs to the functions and think about the results.\n",

Having said that, if you are familiar with python feel free to change whatever you want.\n",

You could complete the table with only the equations, but try playing with the model above to visualize the result.\n",
