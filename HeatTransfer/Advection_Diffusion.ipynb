    "\n",
    "To gain experience with some solutions to this heat equation, we have prepared a Python notebook. The idea is to allow you to vary input parameters for a few scenarios and learn to better anticipate what the results might be. It is not important that you have a background in coding with python. Rather, the intent here is that you adjust inputs to the functions and think about the results.\n",

    "- We have provided helper notes on locations where we think that you should change the code to play around with one of the models (### Please Change! ###) as well as notes in places where you probably shouldn't change the code (### Don't Change ###). Having said that, if you are familiar with python feel free to change whatever you want.\n",

    "- The figures are interactive. Try the sliders, zooming, panning, or rescaling the figure to get a better look at function output."
